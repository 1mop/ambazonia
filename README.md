# ambazonia
A database for the people who have been killed in Ambazonia struggle for sovereignty. Ambazonia is a country that was illegally forced into a union with the republic of cameroon in 1961 by the UN and ever since the people have been fighting to restore their country. The struggle Heightened in 2016 and is ongoing with casualties over 10000 brutally killed by lrc military, over 100000 displaced as refugees in neighboring nigeria and a lot more displaced internally. For purposes of statistics for the future and for posterity, I created this site that Im currently working on as a database to to record information about innocent kids, mothers and those who are getting killed ever in the fight to protect the country . I chose this as my project as I started the journey of learning how to code. I will appreciate any contributions and feedback towards the realization of this project.
